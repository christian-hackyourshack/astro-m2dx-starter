As you might have noticed, this is not pure Markdown.

We are using [non-standard Markdown directives](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/generic-directives-plugins-syntax/444) to declare some extra functionality, and we use [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) in the background to work it's magic on those directives, hence these files must be `.mdx` files, it won't work on `.md` files, sorry.
